This project builds a Spam Detection model using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to classify messages as ham (non-spam) or spam using a Random Forest Classifier and Naive Bayes model.

Key Features:

* SMOTE is used to balance the dataset by generating synthetic spam messages.
* TF-IDF vectorization converts text into numerical vectors for model training.
* Models are evaluated with Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.
* A word cloud visualization shows frequent words in ham and spam messages.
